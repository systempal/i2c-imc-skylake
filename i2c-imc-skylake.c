 * Intel Skylake-X iMC SMBus I2C adapter.
 *
 * The integrated memory controller (iMC) on Intel Skylake-X / Cascade Lake-X
 * processors contains an SMBus engine wired to the DDR4 DIMMs.  It reaches the
 * SPD EEPROMs (0x50-0x57) and the thermal sensors (0x18-0x1f) of the installed
 * modules.  The engine is driven through the PCI configuration space of the
 * Sky Lake-E PCU function (8086:2085).  This driver presents it as two standard
 * Linux I2C adapters - one per hardware SMBus channel - so that i2c-tools,
 * decode-dimms and lm-sensors can use it without bespoke sysfs hacks.
 *
 * Per-channel register triple within the config space of the function:
 *                  ch0     ch1
 *     CMD          0x9C    0xA0   command toggle | GO | address | register
 *     DATA         0xB4    0xB8   write: data byte in bits[23:16]; read: low byte
 *     STATUS       0xA8    0xAC   bit0 BUSY, bit1 ERROR/NACK,
 *                                 bit2 READ_DONE, bit3 WRITE_DONE
 *   SMBus command byte (CMD bits[15:8]) = (rw << 7) | addr7: the 7-bit slave
 *   address with bit7 = direction (1 write / 0 read).  The register/offset goes
 *   in CMD[7:0].  So 0x50 reads SPD EEPROM 0x50.  This was decoded and
 *   confirmed on hardware, and cross-checked against an independent Windows
 *   implementation of the same engine.
 *
 * The two channels are independent SMBus buses (DIMMs 1,2 on ch0; DIMMs 3,4 on
 * ch1), hence two i2c_adapter instances exposed as separate /dev/i2c-* nodes.
 *
 * Bus arbitration / concurrency with firmware:
 *   The driver cannot coordinate with SMM, a BMC, or the iMC's own closed-loop
 *   thermal throttling (CLTT), and the PCI ID alone does not prove that none of
 *   them is active.  Binding is therefore disabled by default and requires
 *   allow_unsafe_access=1, following the same choice made by the earlier iMC
 *   drivers for Sandy Bridge-EP and Broadwell-E.  On top of that, transactions
 *   are serialized across both channels, wait for the complete engine to become
 *   idle, temporarily clear TSOD_ACTIVE, restore the previous command state,
 *   and verify afterwards that no other master modified the command registers
 *   while the transfer was in flight.
 *
 *   Not implemented: the Broadwell-E driver additionally stops the PCU's TSOD
 *   polling for the duration of a transfer (write 0 to the polling interval,
 *   wait 10 ms for in-flight transactions to drain, restore afterwards).  The
 *   equivalent register has not been identified on this part, so a system with
 *   CLTT enabled is expected to trip the interference check below rather than
 *   to be arbitrated against.
